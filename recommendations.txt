Based on the data that we have collected and sorted, we are going to His Eatery for breakfast on day 1 and Jim Dandy for breakfast on day 2. They have higher ratings and lower costs.
For lunch, we are going to the 3 in 1 restaurant on day 1 and day 1 El Abuelo Mexican Restaurant is going on the itnerary to get a different variety of food. 
For dinner day one the Open Kitchen Restaurant is our go to because of the low-medium price tag. Then for day 2 we are going to Bluebeard, it is a little pricier, but it is highly rated and a little more upscale than the other restaurants, so it will be nice way to finish off our weekend excursion.
